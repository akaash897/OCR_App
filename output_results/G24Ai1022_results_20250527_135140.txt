unilaterly changing their strategy, afsusing all
other players are holding their Strastagies contact.

other nodes that have similar characteristics.

notes that act as brides between different
Commanities. Mese nodes often lie on the
Shortest paths between Mary pairs of nades
and contral the cow of the infection between
Lifferent parts of the catwalk.

Question: Page Rank Algorithal
Answer: Entention behind page Rank is based on the idea
that the popularity of a webpage is Letar clued
nat anly by the raacber of dressing lives
but also by the third of den cascadings bures.
istrations prare welly ranked pages contribute
More than lower raulled webpages.

Question: 5.6 Rate of damping factar (d).
Answer: Damping factor (d) represents the peabes willity that
the raider surfer will follow an edging walk
rather than randomly teleporting to amater
page..

Question: 5.C problems with Daughing nodes.
Answer: Daughleg nodes create a leak in pagehank calculatin
- It cases all page house values to approach zero.

Question: Gudan payoff Matrise
Answer:

Strategy-A Strategy-B
Strategy-0 (3,2) (0,1)
Strategy-L (2,0) (2,3)
6.a pure Strategy
(0,A) - plager get's 3, plagar 2 get 2
(0,B) - player gets o, plager 2 gets!
(L,A) - plopen I guls 2, plager 2 get 0
(L,B) - playor gets, player 2 gets 3

Question: 6.b
Answer: For Expected payoffs for A
   E[A] = p x 2 + (1-p) x 0 = 2p

   Expected payoffs for B
   E[B] = p x 1 + (1-p) x 3 = p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 2p

Question: 6.c
Answer: Expected outcome of p = 0.7
   E[A] = 2p = 2 x 0.7 = 1.4
   E[B] = 3 - 2p = 3 - 2 x 0.7 = 1.6

Question 8:
Answer: Neighbors of B n(CB) = {A, C, D}
Given feature vectors
hA = [1], hc = [8], hD = [2]

Find average of initial feature vectors.
h(0) = (h(0) + h(0) + h(0)) = ([1]+[8]+[2]) = 11/3 = (+) = +

Given weight Matrix
W = [0.5 0
0.1 0.2]

W x h(0) = [0.5 0] [t]
0.1 0.2 2
= [0.5x1 + 0x2
0.1x1 + 0.2x2]
= [0.5 + 0
0.1 + 0.4]

o = [0.5]

Okay, here is the corrected transcription of the handwritten text:

(8) Neighbors of B n(CB) = {A, C, D}

Given feature vectors
(0)
hA = [1], hc = [8], hD = [2]

Find average of initial feature vectors.

h(0) = } (h(0) + h(0) + h(0))
n(CB)
A C D
= ([:]+[8]+[3])

= (+) = +

Given weight Matrix

W = [0.5 0
0.1 0.2]

W x h(0) = [0.5 0] [t]
n(CB) 0.1 0.2 2
= [0.5x1 + 0x2
0.1x1 + 0.2x2]
