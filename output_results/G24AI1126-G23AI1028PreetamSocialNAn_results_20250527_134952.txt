Question 6: Finding Nash equilibria- identifying if a player outcome can imprime (a) by changing strateg. (1) Player I's strategy "U" v/s Player 2's A.
Player 1 Player 2

Player 1 switering from Uoo L, Playoff decreases from (3 to 2)
Player 2 switering from A to B decreases players from (2 to 1). (U, A) is a Nash equilibrium
(2) U vs B. Play 2 from B to A, increases playoff 0 to 3. X doesnt querity to 2
Play 2 switering from BtoA Playoff increases 1 to 2. X Noman.
(3) (L,A) play I swit L to U P. Off 2 ->3 X doent increases quality Play 1 A to B. increases, doent P. Off 0 -> 3 X al.
(4) (L,B) Playerl Sw. from (L to U) Play off decrease 2 to 0. Dikon Player 2 Sw from B to A, 3 -> 0
(a) So, pure strategy Nash equilibria are (UIA), and (LIB) where unilater change of strategy reduces chance of playoff for both players.
