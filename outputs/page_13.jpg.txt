Answer-C

for Player 2!
E(A) = 2P = 2×0.7 = 1.4
E[B] = 3-2P = 3-2×0.7= 1.6
Since E[B] > E[A]. Player 2 Could Choose Strategy B.
for Player 1. (0.7U, 0.32)
Expected payoff = 0.7 ×0 +0.3×2
= 0.6 (when Player 2 Choose B)
The expected Outcomes for Player 1. receives a payoff
of 0.6 & Player 2 receive payoff of 1.6.
