The incidence matrix Provided is!
$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$
The matrix Structure has been given the namel. Bach edge in an
incidence matrix Corresponds to a row and every node has its
designated Column. Bach entry of value '1' shows that the node
has an incidence with the edge. A Simple undirected graphs
contains exactly two adjacent nodes for every single edge within it.
From the incidence matrix
→ Edge 1 Connect Node 1 and Node 2.
→ Edge 2 Connect Node 2 and Node 3
→ Edge 3 Connects Node 2 and Node 4
