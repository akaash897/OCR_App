→ The connection, relationship between nodes in a graph Structure appear
in adjacency matrix format. The adjacency matrix contains value
1 in Positions (i, j) and (j, i) when node i and Node j having
an edge, otherwise both position contain 0.
The adjacency matrix will represent node to node connection.

Answer - (B)
Ans → Option -(B) → Erdős - Rényi (Random Network) Model.
→ In the Erdős - Rényi model the edges connect randomly
because every edge formation remaining isolated from other
edges.
Answer - (C)
Ans → Option -(C) → Nash Equilibrium
→ Players reach a stable position known as Nash Equilibrium when
none of them achieve higher rewards through independent
strategy modifications.
