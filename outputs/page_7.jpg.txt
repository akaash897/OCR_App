Justification →
A combined approach delivers better results since
betweenness centrality identifies network bridge which
link different network section while degree centrality
distinguishes hubs that spread widely.
→Vaccinating key hubs and bridges provides maximum
efficiency by controlling both small outbreaks and
widespread distribution of the value virus.
Question-3
Answer-
Suggested Collaborations features
Links prediction → System utilizes linking prediction algorithms
that generate potential collaboration prediction
through the analysis of current co-authorship
and citation data.
→When researchers A and B demonstrate numerous
joint authors link with each other scientist a
link prediction method could indicate potential
collaboration between them.
→Through Node2Vec the system creates vector representations
of researchers based on network structural
information. Embedding that align with each other
between researchers demonstrates similar research
interest and collaboration potential.
