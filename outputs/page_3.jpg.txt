Connects with each other.
Answer-(e)
Answer- Option (D) Because it quantifies how often a node lies on the
Shortest Paths between other nodes.
→The measurement technique Called Betweenness Centrality
evaluate node based on their Capacity to link other
nodes because it determines information flow efficiencies.
Answer-(f)!
Answer→Option- (C)→The presence of many nodes with very high
degrees (hubs) that maintain Connectivity.
→Scale-free Network (Hubs) operate through Central nodes
which serve a crucial Connections. So their attack
Vulnerability becomes particularly pronounced.
