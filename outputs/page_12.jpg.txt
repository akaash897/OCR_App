→Player 2: SINItch to A → 0<3, no improvemed
→ Nash equilibrium,
.. There are two Pure Strategy hash equilibrium : (U,A) &
(L,B).
Ans-(b)
→ Player 1 Play U with probability P, L with probability
1-P.
→ Player 2's Strategy.
→ Expected Payoff for Player 2 if changing Strategy A
E [A] = P x 2 + (1-P) x 0 = 2P
→ Expicted pay off for Player 2 if changing Strategy B-
E[B] = P x 1 + (1-P) x 3
= P + 3 (1-P)
= P + 3 - 3P = 3-2P
