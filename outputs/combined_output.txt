Question-1
Answer-(a)
Incidence Matrix to Adjacency Matrix
The incidence matrix Provided is!
$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$
The matrix Structure has been given the namel. Bach edge in an
incidence matrix Corresponds to a row and every node has its
designated Column. Bach entry of value '1' shows that the node
has an incidence with the edge. A Simple undirected graphs
contains exactly two adjacent nodes for every single edge within it.
From the incidence matrix
→ Edge 1 Connect Node 1 and Node 2.
→ Edge 2 Connect Node 2 and Node 3
→ Edge 3 Connects Node 2 and Node 4


=== page_2.jpg ===
→ The connection, relationship between nodes in a graph Structure appear
in adjacency matrix format. The adjacency matrix contains value
1 in Positions (i, j) and (j, i) when node i and Node j having
an edge, otherwise both position contain 0.
The adjacency matrix will represent node to node connection.

Answer - (B)
Ans → Option -(B) → Erdős - Rényi (Random Network) Model.
→ In the Erdős - Rényi model the edges connect randomly
because every edge formation remaining isolated from other
edges.
Answer - (C)
Ans → Option -(C) → Nash Equilibrium
→ Players reach a stable position known as Nash Equilibrium when
none of them achieve higher rewards through independent
strategy modifications.

Answer- (d)
Answer→Option- (B) Assonlative Mixing
→Under the Concept of Assontalive Mixing Similar Nodes Establish
Connects with each other.
Answer-(e)
Answer- Option (D) Because it quantifies how often a node lies on the
Shortest Paths between other nodes.
→The measurement technique Called Betweenness Centrality
evaluate node based on their Capacity to link other
nodes because it determines information flow efficiencies.
Answer-(f)!
Answer→Option- (C)→The presence of many nodes with very high
degrees (hubs) that maintain Connectivity.
→Scale-free Network (Hubs) operate through Central nodes
which serve a crucial Connections. So their attack
Vulnerability becomes particularly pronounced.
Answer-(g)
Answer→Option- (A) The number of intra-Community edges is
Significantly aims higher than expected in
a random network with the same degree
Sequence.


=== page_4.jpg ===
The goal of Community detection (Modularity) is to identify 4
Communities through dense Connection within those group
Compared to random Chance expectation.
Answer-(H)
Answer→ Option-(B) 2/5
→Jaccard Coefficient,
Neighbory of X: A, B, C, D
Neighbours of Y: C, D, E.
Intersection: C, D (2 nodes)
Union: A, B, C, D, E (5 nodes)
Jaccards Coefficient = Intersection/Union = 2/5 = 0.4
The Jaccords Coefficient Calculates set (neighbors) Similarity by
dividing the overlapping intersection by their combined elements.
Answer-(?)
Answer→ Option-(B)→ LTM Uses edge Probabilities independently;
LTM uses a weighted Sum of active
neighbors Compared to a node threshold.
→CH operates through independent edge probabilities but LTM
Adopts a threshold-based method which takes the
weighted Sum of neighbors impact.


=== page_5.jpg ===
Answer-(j)
Answer→Option-(B)→ Because aggregating features, from dissimilar
neighbors can blur the node's own represen
-tative features, making classification harder.
→When the terophily occurs during GCN and Heterophily
operations it become difficult to classify nodes because
they lose their individual characteristics through the
features aggregation process from dissimilar neighbors.

Question-2
Answer-2
Influenza Spread and Vaccination
→ for reducing influenza transmission to 5%. level ce combined
approach of Centrality measurement Should be used to
determine who get Vaccinated first.
→ A high Value of betucorners Centrality reveals that the
node function as a "bridge" through which the disease transmit
to numerous Other Connection. The immunization of there
Specific people break transmission pathways between different
Segment of the network.
→ High, degree Centrality helps identify "hubs" which possess
numerous Connection since they have the potential to infect
multiple other people.
→ A Computation between and degree Centrality Should be
performed for every individual.
→ A list of named people forms based on the Centrality
measurement result.
→ The group of people Selected for vaccination needs
a Strong ranking in both Centrality measures.
→ Additional individual Should be included for vaccine
-tion Until 5%. Coverage is reached if the
top Selected candidates do not suffice.


=== page_7.jpg ===
Justification →
A combined approach delivers better results since
betweenness centrality identifies network bridge which
link different network section while degree centrality
distinguishes hubs that spread widely.
→Vaccinating key hubs and bridges provides maximum
efficiency by controlling both small outbreaks and
widespread distribution of the value virus.
Question-3
Answer-
Suggested Collaborations features
Links prediction → System utilizes linking prediction algorithms
that generate potential collaboration prediction
through the analysis of current co-authorship
and citation data.
→When researchers A and B demonstrate numerous
joint authors link with each other scientist a
link prediction method could indicate potential
collaboration between them.
→Through Node2Vec the system creates vector representations
of researchers based on network structural
information. Embedding that align with each other
between researchers demonstrates similar research
interest and collaboration potential.

Homophily
→ Due to the natinal human technology of homophily the
System will provide recommendation related to researchers
within Similar academic fields.
→ Due to encouraging diverse Collabonatiue Has the system
requines a diversity matric within It recommendation.
functionality. Although the link prediction Score may
be Stightly lower the Systern will give priority to
Mesearch links that Combiner field from distinct areas.
Question-4
Answer-(a)
Crinvan-Newman Core Idea
→The Crinuan - Newman algorithm detects Communities
through a processing method which successively
Climinates edges Connecting different Commenities.
Answer-(b)
Edge Betweenners Centrality →
→ Edge Betweenners Centrality analyzes the number of times
an edge lies between all pains of nodes to discover
there edges. etc.
→ Edges with high betweenners values link Seperate
Commenities according to this method.

ility expressed through the Damping facton (d) either
to Pause their link clicks on to move to an
arbitrary Page.
Answer-(c)
Dangling Nodes
→ The lack of outgoing links from Dangling Nodes makes
Page Rank flow through the network. we handle this

Question-6
Strategy A| Strategy B
Strategy U (3,2) (0,1)
Strategy L (2,0) (2,3)
11
Answer-(a)
→ A Strategy pain where Player can improve their payoff
byunilaterally changing their Strategy.
→ Check each point
(U, A): Pay off (3,2)
→ Player 1: SNitch to L → 2<3, no improve
→ Player 2: SNitch to B → 1<2, no improve
→ Nash equilibrium.
(U, B): Payoff (0,1)
→ Player 1: SNitch L → 2>0, improve
→ Not Nash
(L, B): Payoff (2,3)
→ Player 1: SNitch to U → 0<2 No improve


=== page_12.jpg ===
→Player 2: SINItch to A → 0<3, no improvemed
→ Nash equilibrium,
.. There are two Pure Strategy hash equilibrium : (U,A) &
(L,B).
Ans-(b)
→ Player 1 Play U with probability P, L with probability
1-P.
→ Player 2's Strategy.
→ Expected Payoff for Player 2 if changing Strategy A
E [A] = P x 2 + (1-P) x 0 = 2P
→ Expicted pay off for Player 2 if changing Strategy B-
E[B] = P x 1 + (1-P) x 3
= P + 3 (1-P)
= P + 3 - 3P = 3-2P


=== page_13.jpg ===
Answer-C

for Player 2!
E(A) = 2P = 2×0.7 = 1.4
E[B] = 3-2P = 3-2×0.7= 1.6
Since E[B] > E[A]. Player 2 Could Choose Strategy B.
for Player 1. (0.7U, 0.32)
Expected payoff = 0.7 ×0 +0.3×2
= 0.6 (when Player 2 Choose B)
The expected Outcomes for Player 1. receives a payoff
of 0.6 & Player 2 receive payoff of 1.6.
