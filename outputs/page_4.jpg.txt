The goal of Community detection (Modularity) is to identify 4
Communities through dense Connection within those group
Compared to random Chance expectation.
Answer-(H)
Answer→ Option-(B) 2/5
→Jaccard Coefficient,
Neighbory of X: A, B, C, D
Neighbours of Y: C, D, E.
Intersection: C, D (2 nodes)
Union: A, B, C, D, E (5 nodes)
Jaccards Coefficient = Intersection/Union = 2/5 = 0.4
The Jaccords Coefficient Calculates set (neighbors) Similarity by
dividing the overlapping intersection by their combined elements.
Answer-(?)
Answer→ Option-(B)→ LTM Uses edge Probabilities independently;
LTM uses a weighted Sum of active
neighbors Compared to a node threshold.
→CH operates through independent edge probabilities but LTM
Adopts a threshold-based method which takes the
weighted Sum of neighbors impact.
