Answer-(a)
→ A Strategy pain where Player can improve their payoff
byunilaterally changing their Strategy.
→ Check each point
(U, A): Pay off (3,2)
→ Player 1: SNitch to L → 2<3, no improve
→ Player 2: SNitch to B → 1<2, no improve
→ Nash equilibrium.
(U, B): Payoff (0,1)
→ Player 1: SNitch L → 2>0, improve
→ Not Nash
(L, B): Payoff (2,3)
→ Player 1: SNitch to U → 0<2 No improve
