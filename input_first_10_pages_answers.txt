FINAL MACHINE-READABLE ANSWERS (using model gemini-2.0-flash, from first 10 pages of input.pdf):

Question 1: (a) Incidence Matrix to Adjacency Matrix
The incidence matrix Provided is:
```
1    0    0
1    1    1
0    1    0
0    0    1
```
The matrix Structure has been given the namel, Bach edge in an incidence matrix Corresponds to a row and every node has its designated Column. Bach entry of value '1' shows that the node incidence with the edge. A Simple undirected graphs Contains exactly two adjacenti nodes fon avery single edge within it. From the incidence matrix:
→ Edge 1 Connect Nude 1 and Node 2.
→Edge 2 Connect Nude 2 and Node 3
→ Edge 3 Conneus Node 2 and Node 4

→ The Connection, relationship between nodes in a graph Structure apkar in adjacency matrix format. The adjacency matrix contains volue 1 in Positions (i, j) and (j, ⅰ) when nude i and Nodej having An edge, other wise both Position Contain 0. The adjacency matrix will represent node to node Connection.
```
  1 2 3 4
1 0 1 0 0
2 1 0 1 1
3 0 1 0 0
4 0 1 0 0
```
(B) Endős- Rényi (Random Network) Model.
→ In the Erdős-Rényi model the edges Connect randomly because every edge formation remaing isulated from other edges.

(C) Nash Equilibrium...
→Player hone Meach a stable position Known as Nash Equilibriom when of them achieve higher rewards through independent Strategy modifications.

(d) Assortative Mixing
→ Under the Concept of Assortative Mixing Similar Nodes establish Connect with each other.

(e) Because it quantifies how often a node lies on the Shortest paths between other nodes.
→ The measurement technique Called Betweenness centrality evaluate node based on their Capacity to link other nodes because it determines information flow efficiencies.

(f) The presence of many nodes with very high degrees (hubs) that maintain Connectivity.
→ Scale-free Network (Hubs) operate through Central nodes which serve a Crucial Connectors. so their attack Vulnerability becomes particularly pronounced.

(g) The number of intra- Community edges is Significantly aims higher than expected in a random network with the same degree Sequence.
→The goal of Community detection (Modularity) is to identify Communities through dense Connection within those Group Compared to random Chance expectation.

(h) 2
→Jaccard Coefficient,
Neighbory of X: A, B, CID
Neighbours of Y: C, D, E.
Intersection: C, D. (2 rodes)
Union: A, B, C, D, EC5 nodes)
Jaccards Coefficient = Intersection / Union = 2 / 5 = 0.4
The Jaccards Coefficient Calculates set (neighbors) Similarity by dividing the overlapping intersection by their Combined elements.

(i) LTM Uses edge Probabilities independently, LTM uses a weighted Sum of active heighbors Compared to a node threshold.
→ CM operates through independent edge probabilities but LTM adopts a threshold-based method which takes the weighted Sum of neighbors impact.

(3) Because aggregating features, from dissimilar neighbors can blur the node's own representative features, making Classification harder.
-> When Heterophily occurs during GCN and Heterophily Operations it become difficult to Classify nodes because they lose their individual Characteristics through the features aggregation process from dissimilar neighbors.

Question 2: Influenza Spread and Vaccination
→ fon reducing influenza transmision to 5%. level ce combined approach of Centrality measurement Should be vied to determine who get Vaccinated finst.
→ A high Value of betucerrners Contrality reveals that the node function as a "bridge" through which the disease transmit to numerous Other Connection. The immunization of there Specific People break transmission pathways between different Segment of the network.
→ High, degree Centrality helps identify "hub's" which Possess humerous Connection since they have the potential to infect multiple other people.
→ A Computation beturcenen and degree Centrality Should be Performed for Query individual!
→ A list of nanthed people forms based on the Contrality measurement result.
→ The grocip of people Selected for vaccination needs a strong ranking in both Ceritiality measures.
→ Additional individual Should be included for vaccina -tion Until 5%. Coverage: is reached if the top Selected candidates do not suffice.

Justification:
→ A Combined approach delivery better results since betweenness Centrality identifies network bridge which link different network Section while degree centrality distinguishes hubs that Spread widely.
→Vaccinating key hubs and bridges provides maximum Efficiency by Controlling both Small Outbreaks and Widespread distribution of the value Virus.

Question 3: Suggested Collaborators features

Links Prediction→ System Utilizes linking Prediction algorithms that Generate potential Collaboration prediction through the analysis of current Co-authorship and Citation data.
→ When researchers A and B demonstrate numerous joint authors link with each other Scientist a link prediction method Could Incidate Potential Collaboration, between them,
→ Through Node 2Vec the System Creator vector: representa - tions of researchers based on network Structural information.. Embedding that align with each other between Researcher, demonstrates Similar research Interest and Collaboration potential.

Homophily
→ Due to the natınal huonan technology of homophily the System will provide recommendation related to Mescarchers within Similan academic fields.
→ Due to encouraging diverse Collubionatiue Hoy the System requires a diversity matnia within it Mecommendation functionality. Although the link mediction Score may be Stightly lower the Systern will give priority to Mesearch links that Combine field from distinct areas.

Question 4: (a) Crinvan- Newman Core Idea
→The Grinvan-Neowman algorithms detects Communities through a processing method which successively climinaten edges Connecting different Commemities.

(b) Edge Betweenners Centrality →
→ Edge Betweenners Centrality analyzes the number of times an adge lies between all pains of nodes to discover there edges. Ed.
→ Edges with high betweenners values link Seperate Commenities according to this method.

(C) Computational limitation
→ The cost of Compuctional increases Substantially when Calculating edge betweeners centrality or extensive network especially when they inwue frequent edge removal Operation.

(d) Louvain Method
→ The Louvain method function as a Scalable approach twhich Uses Greedy Optimization to Shift nodes between Commentties deering its iterative Mocers.

Question 5: (a) PageRank Algorithm
→ According to Page Rank the imponternce of nodes denonds on both the quantity and quality Of incoming links passing through them.
→ Page: importance derives from other Pages, that link to it.

(b) Damping Facton (d)
During Mandom web navigation a Surfor, has a Probab -lility expressed through the Damping facton (1d) either to Pause their link. Clicks on to move to an arbitrary page.

(C) Dangling Nodes
→ The lack of outgoing linke from Dangling Nodes makes Page Rank flow through the network. we handle this Condition using an equal distribution amang all network hodes.
→ Each iteration distribution the rank of dangking hoder across all network nodes in an equal way.
